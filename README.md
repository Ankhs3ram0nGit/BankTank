# Bank Tank
## Setup (Important)
When you first open the app, you must do these things before you can really use it:

Create an Account

Go to the Home screen and add at least one account.

Accounts hold your money and are needed to add transactions.

Set Max Allocation

Go to the Tanks tab.

Press Manage and set the Max Allocation.

Max Allocation means how much total budget you want to split across all your tanks (categories).

Example: if you want to budget 1000, set Max Allocation to 1000.

Add at least one Tank

Still in Manage Tanks, press Add Tank.

Tanks are your spending categories (like Food, Transport, etc).

Each tank will have an allocation limit you choose, but the total of all tanks can't go over Max Allocation.

After this, the app is ready to track your expenses and savings.

## Screens and What You Can Do
### Home / Accounts Screen
Add accounts using the button at the bottom right.

See account details by clicking on an account.

In the account details screen:

Add a transaction by pressing the Add button.

View full transaction details by tapping on any transaction.

### Tanks Screen
View all your tanks (budgets) and how full they are.

Press Manage to:

Edit Max Allocation (total budget cap).

Add new tanks.

Edit or delete tanks.

Tap on a tank to see its detailed view:

View how much has been spent inside that category.

Add transactions directly linked to that tank.

Important:

Tank bars show how much you've used compared to your allocation.

The outline of the bar shows your total allocation, and the filled color shows how much is left.

### Savings Screen
Shows your special Savings tank at the top (this is auto-created).

Below that, you can add Savings Goals (like saving for a trip).

Track how much progress you've made toward each goal.

### Other Screen
Currently it has some settings features such as starting a new financial cycle and inverting the tank fill view.

Starting a new cycle will move whatever is left from you tanks over to your savings. This is when you receive your income and start your new cycle of spending and budgeting.

## Notes
Dark Mode is on by default.

All your data is saved on your device using SQLite (no internet needed).
